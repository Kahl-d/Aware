## üéØ Research Context

### Cultural Capital Theory
The Aware project is grounded in Yosso's (2005) framework of community cultural wealth, which identifies six forms of cultural capital that students from marginalized communities bring to educational settings:

1. **Aspirational Capital**: Ability to maintain hopes and dreams despite barriers
2. **Familial Capital**: Cultural knowledge nurtured among family members
3. **Social Capital**: Networks of people and community resources
4. **Navigational Capital**: Skills to maneuver through social institutions
5. **Resistance Capital**: Knowledge and skills fostered through oppositional behavior
6. **Linguistic Capital**: Intellectual and social skills attained through communication

### Educational Equity in STEM
Research has shown that Cultural Capital themes often surface in reflective journaling during classroom activities, particularly in STEM fields where the influence of culture and social assets on student success and persistence is significant.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
Identifying Cultural Capital themes in student essays presents unique computational challenges:

1. **Context Dependency**: The meaning of a sentence often depends on the surrounding narrative within the full essay
2. **Subtle Expressions**: Cultural Capital themes are typically implied rather than explicitly stated
3. **Theme Overlap**: Multiple themes can co-occur within a single sentence or passage
4. **Domain Specificity**: Student essay language differs significantly from general text corpora
5. **Limited Data**: Small, specialized datasets make traditional ML approaches challenging

### Manual Annotation Limitations
- Requires months of training for human annotators
- Slow and expensive process
- Often needs multiple annotators and iterations to reach agreement
- Not scalable for large-scale educational applications

## üî¨ Methodology

### Research Questions
1. How can we develop a computational framework to automatically identify Cultural Capital themes in student essays?
2. What role does domain adaptation play in improving theme identification accuracy?
3. How does essay-level context awareness affect classification performance compared to sentence-level approaches?
4. What are the optimal strategies for handling multi-label classification with overlapping themes?

### Proposed Framework: "Aware"
The Aware framework addresses these challenges through a three-stage pipeline:

#### Stage 1: Domain Awareness (DAPT)
- **Objective**: Adapt language models to student essay domain
- **Method**: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training on unlabeled student essays
- **Model**: DeBERTa-v3-large with continued training
- **Evaluation**: Perplexity reduction and qualitative analysis

#### Stage 2: Context Awareness (Essay-Aware Architecture)
- **Objective**: Preserve essay-level narrative context
- **Method**: Process entire essays with attention pooling and BiLSTM
- **Innovation**: Character-to-token span mapping for sentence boundary preservation
- **Evaluation**: Context dependency resolution

#### Stage 3: Theme Awareness (Multi-Label Classification)
- **Objective**: Handle theme overlap and co-occurrence
- **Method**: Multi-label classification with Focal Loss and optimal threshold tuning
- **Strategy**: Ensemble learning with cross-validation

## üß™ Experimental Design

### Dataset
- **Source**: San Francisco State University Physics & Astronomy Department
- **Collection Method**: Structured journaling activities with prompts like "Why are you here?"
- **Size**: 1,499 unique essays, 10,921 unique sentences
- **Annotation**: Expert annotators identified 11 Cultural Capital themes + neutral class
- **Distribution**: 26.17% sentences contain themes, 73.83% neutral

### Cultural Capital Themes
1. **Aspirational**: Future goals and ambitions
2. **Attainment**: Academic/career achievements  
3. **Community Consciousness**: Social responsibility
4. **Familial**: Family-related motivations
5. **Filial Piety**: Respect for parents/family
6. **First Generation**: First-gen college experiences
7. **Navigational**: Navigating academic systems
8. **Perseverance**: Overcoming challenges
9. **Resistance**: Resistance to systems
10. **Social**: Social connections
11. **Spiritual**: Spiritual/philosophical motivations

### Experimental Setup

#### Baseline Model
- **Architecture**: DeBERTa-v3-large with sequence classification head
- **Input**: Individual sentences (max 512 tokens)
- **Training**: 5-fold cross-validation with iterative stratification
- **Loss**: Focal Loss with label smoothing

#### Essay-Aware Model
- **Architecture**: DeBERTa-v3-large + Attention Pooling + BiLSTM
- **Input**: Full essays (max 1024 tokens)
- **Context**: Inter-sentence relationships via BiLSTM
- **Training**: Same cross-validation strategy as baseline

#### Evaluation Metrics
- **Macro F1-Score**: Average F1 across all themes
- **Micro F1-Score**: Overall F1 considering all predictions
- **Hamming Loss**: Fraction of incorrectly predicted labels
- **Per-Theme Performance**: Individual theme precision, recall, F1

## üìä Results and Analysis

### Overall Performance Comparison

| Model | Macro F1 | Micro F1 | Hamming Loss |
|-------|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Base Model** | 0.5135 | 0.8050 | 0.0370 |
| **Essay-Aware** | **0.5329** | **0.8255** | **0.0328** |

### Key Findings

#### 1. Essay-Aware Architecture Improves Performance
- **Macro F1 Improvement**: +0.0194 (3.8% relative improvement)
- **Micro F1 Improvement**: +0.0205 (2.5% relative improvement)
- **Hamming Loss Reduction**: -0.0042 (11.4% relative improvement)

#### 2. Theme-Specific Performance Analysis

**Strong Performing Themes:**
- **Aspirational** (F1: 0.83): Clear goal-oriented language
- **Filial Piety** (F1: 0.74): Distinct family respect patterns
- **First Generation** (F1: 0.74): Specific first-gen experiences

**Challenging Themes:**
- **Perseverance** (F1: 0.00): Very limited examples (23 instances)
- **Resistance** (F1: 0.10): Extremely rare (6 instances)
- **Community Consciousness** (F1: 0.36): Subtle social responsibility expressions

#### 3. Context Dependency Resolution
- Essay-aware model shows better performance on context-dependent sentences
- Examples where context improved classification:
  - "They helped me..." ‚Üí Requires essay context to identify "they" as family vs. friends
  - "I learned to navigate..." ‚Üí Context determines if navigating academic or social systems

#### 4. Domain Adaptation Benefits
