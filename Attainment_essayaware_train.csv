essay_00839,s006244,for example the equation for an object throw (the parabola) is just given such as something like 16t2 8t 32.,0
essay_00839,s006245,which just gives us the ability to calculate the velocity or acceleration of the thrown object at a given time but i do not necessarily know how to arrive at the equation if we were to actually perform the experiment in real life.,0

essay_01200,s008874,"being in that class and hearing the instructors focus in topics we were unsure about whether it was in the videos they posted on ilearn, or the kahoot games, or the practice tests we were given before an exam really helped me to have a better understanding of what was going on in the course.",0
essay_01200,s008875,"it was also great with how the class itself interacted, were if there was anything someone comprehended really well they would try to explain it in another way that we werent told in lecture, or even by the instructors, so there was a variety of ways to break down the information for whomever needed it.",0

essay_01434,s010479,im in this class to get all the help i can.,0
essay_01434,s010480,i find it really hard to retain information during the lecture because its so much information to receive in such a short amount of time.,0
essay_01434,s010481,and the class is huge so the professors cant check for understanding with every single student.,0
essay_01434,s010482,sci 230 really makes things more clear.,0
